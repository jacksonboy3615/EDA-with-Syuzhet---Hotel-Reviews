# 🏨 US Hotel Reviews — EDA with Syuzhet Sentiment Analysis

Full Analysis: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jackjaehwankim/eda-with-syuzhet-hotel-reviews

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of 20,000 hotel reviews across the United States, using R programming for data cleaning, sentiment classification, and visualization.

The analysis applies the Syuzhet sentiment library to identify emotional tone and measure customer satisfaction from written reviews. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle – Hotel Reviews
.

# ⚙️ Approach

Goal: Identify the states with the highest number of hotels and the highest hospitality rating, top-rated hotels across the United States, as well as the popular platforms for hotel reviews

Rather than relying solely on average star ratings, this project evaluates performance based on the positive review percentage and the number of positive reviews.
This provides a more reliable measure of consistent guest satisfaction.

The positive review percentage captures the quality of guest experiences, showing how consistently visitors feel satisfied. Meanwhile, the number of positive reviews reflects the quantity or strength of customer engagement — how many guests were motivated to share positive feedback.

For example:

A hotel with just one 5-star review may appear perfect by average rating alone.

However, another hotel with thirty 5-star reviews and ten 4-star reviews clearly demonstrates more consistent quality and reliability.

This approach ensures the analysis captures not just how high the ratings are, but how often guests express satisfaction.
